# Alcohol  
  
- “Alcohol is one of the world’s top three priority public health areas.” ([World Health Organization and Regional Office for Europe, 2012, p. 01](zotero://select/library/items/2S6V9I37))  
  
  
## Alcohol consumption  
  
- use  
	- “it seems that low to moderate alcohol consumption is a proxy for a range of personality traits that have a positive influence on human capital.” ([World Health Organization and Regional Office for Europe, 2012, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/2S6V9I37))  
  
### Health impacts  
- alcohol-related cancers  
  
  
#### Sociopsychological harm

#### But a glass of wine never killed nobody, right?  
- Is low to moderate alcohol use a positive factor for ischaemic events?  
	- “Studies have shown that middle-aged and older light to moderate drinkers are less likely to die from ischaemic events (coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke and type 2 diabetes) than abstainers.” ([World Health Organization and Regional Office for Europe, 2012, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/2S6V9I37))  
		- however it may be intertwined with confounders, it is not the low use itself, but the choice of low consumption in the world of ubiquitous alcohol use that may indicate one's better social capital and their ability for healthy choices  
			- “it seems that the real protective effect is lower and occurs at a lower dose of alcohol than previously thought.” (World Health Organization and Regional Office for Europe, 2012, p. 2)  
  
- “In any case, there is no protective effect for younger people, where any dose of alcohol increases the risk of ischaemic events.” ([World Health Organization and Regional Office for Europe, 2012, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/2S6V9I37))  
  
- “in older people, a greater reduction in death from ischaemic heart disease could be obtained by being physically active and eating a healthier diet than by drinking a low dose of alcoho” ([World Health Organization and Regional Office for Europe, 2012, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/2S6V9I37))  
  
  
  
### Advertising effects on consumption  
  
- US  
  
	- [Annotations - Saffer and Dave, “Alcohol Advertising and Alcohol Consumption by Adolescents.”](https://gr00stl.myeu.cloud/index.php/s/sBYSYnaNB3AZL53)  
	  
		- “Price and advertising effects are generally larger for females relative to males”   
		  
		- “Results from the NLSY97 suggest that a 28% reduction in alcohol advertising would reduce adolescent monthly alcohol participation from 25% to between 24 and 21%”   
		  
		- “For binge participation, the reduction would be from 12% to between 11 and 8%”   
		  
		- “The past month price participation elasticity is estimated at 0.26, consistent with prior studies.”   
		  
		- “effects may vary by race and gender”   
		  
		- “For past month and binge participation, the magnitudes are 0.26 and 0.18,”   
  
- EU  
  
	- [Annotations - de Bruijn et al., “European Longitudinal Study on the Relationship between Adolescents’ Alcohol Marketing Exposure and Alcohol Use.”](https://gr00stl.myeu.cloud/index.php/s/m6xa9D7LZiFm3HW)  
	  
		- “School-based sample in 181 state-funded schools in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland.”   
		  
		- “(mean age 14 years, 49.5% male.”   
		  
		- “The analyses showed one-directional long-term effects of alcohol marketing exposure on drinking”   
		  
		- “There appears to be a one-way effect of alcohol marketing exposure on adolescents’ alcohol use over time, which cannot be explained by either previous drinking or exposure to nonalcohol-branded marketing.”   
		  
		- “Frequency of recent alcohol use was established by asking respondents at T1, T2 and T3: ‘On how many occasions (if any) have you had any alcoholic beverage to drink during the last 30 days?’”   
		  
		- “We considered alcohol marketing exposure as a latent variable [35], indicated by 13 alcohol marketing items measuring exposure to online alcohol marketing, televised alcohol advertising, alcohol sport sponsorship, music event/festival sponsorship, ownership of alcohol-branded promotional items and reception of free samples and exposure to price offers”   
		  
		- “‘On a usual school day (Monday to Friday) how much hours do you spend using the internet?’.”   
		  
		- “Frequency of exposure to non-alcohol sponsored football championships was included, and was similar to the measure of exposure to alcohol-sponsored football championships.”   
		  
		- “exposure to non-alcohol-branded television programmes and internet use did not increase the fit of the model and were excluded from the final model.”   
		  
		- “Examination of the parameter estimates showed that the effect of alcohol marketing exposure at T1 to frequency of past-month drinking at T2 was statistically significant [estimate = 0.420; standard error (SE) = 0.058; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.324 – 0.515; P < 0.001, standardized estimate = 0.140].”   
		  
		- “drinking at T1 and T2 to alcohol marketing exposure at T2 and T3, respectively, was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).”   
		  
		- “Our findings suggest that when considering the reciprocal process between alcohol marketing exposure and alcohol use at each timepoint, there remains a one-way effect of alcohol marketing exposure on adolescents’ alcohol use over time”   
		  
		- “When taking into account the impact of alcoholbranded media exposure, we found non-alcohol-branded media exposure not to be associated with adolescents’ drinking.”   
		  
		- “We examined the causal order of alcohol marketing exposure and drinking using an autoregressive crosslagged model, which is seen as an appropriate method”

# Lecture: Collapse of soviet union  
  
>The party had been strong and the state had been weak  
  
- final days of soviet union  
	- 12/05/1990  
		- baltic enatente signed  
	- 12/06/1990  
		- In June of that year the Congress of People's Deputies in Russia, that is where Yeltsin was run initially as a deputy and then become president, declared that it was sovereign over Russia's territory.  
	- 17/03/1991  
		- refereundum whether to say in soviet union  
		- there were boycotts from the Baltics and four or five other Soviet republics  
	- 12/06/1991  
		- boris yeltsin elected president  
	- 20/12/1991  
		- leaders of the 11 remaining republic met in Alma Ata, now know as Almaty, in Kazakhstan to essentially declare the Soviet Union dead and constitute the CIS, the Confederation of Independent States. At that point Gorbachev realized he had no choice,  
  
# Why did soviet union collapse  
  
## ineffective economy  
- You could buy things, there was a black market, you could buy things to some extent on the black market, but there's a **hugely inefficient** command system that had basically ceased to function.  
	- prices are set by decree  
	- poor incentives to work  
	- unsustainable economy has become even more unsustainable!  
  
## containment  
- **containment worked**⚠️  
	- the soviet system  
	- containment - prevent their expansion and wait  
		- their system won't work without expansion!  
  
## Afghanistan  
- they invaded Afghanistan  
	- difficult country to invade  
		- they learnt nothing from British  
  
# Why was the collapse peaceful  
  
  >you would think if somebody shoots an elephant it's gonna stumble around and do an awful lot of damage before it finally collapses. This elephant basically just knelt down and died.  
  
- albert rischman  
	- "Exit, Voice, and Loyalty" in 1970 #books/social-science  
	- the framework he developed is a great basis for an analysis of the collapse  
		- 3 stances you can take on when company collapses  
			- One is, you can leave, exit.  
				- when there is low cost of exit -> shares, no commitment  
			- Two is you can complain and try and get it changed, voice.  
				- when there is some commitment  
				- worker can't just exit -> exit cost is higher  
					- joining union etc.  
			- Three, you can try to fix it yourself. You believe in the cause and you want to make it better.  
	- And a lot of Hirschman's analysis says that what mix of exit, voice, and loyalty people engage in is determined by the costs of those things.  
		- calculate costs   
  
## Loyalty  
- Collapse of elite & citizen **loyalty** in the 80s and 90s  
	- widespread corruption  
	- vadim zagladin's revelation  
		- >"we have concluded that soviet system is insustainable"  
		- country led by elites who didn't believe in public ideology of the country  
	- nobody was defending the communism  
  
## Exit  
- if the cost of exit is low and there is no loyalty, why not quit?  
  
### political costs  
- reduced political costs of exit  
	- boris yeltsin  
	- eduard shevardnadze  
  
  
### economic costs  
- reduced economic costs of exit  
	- rise of the gangster capitalism  
		- >whence the oligarchs?  
  
#### Ganster capitalism origins  
- offshore accounts in since 80s controlled by bureaucrats  
	- coup attempt made soviet bureaucracy dissapear  
	- thus the money was handled by private people then  
  
- theft of state assets  
	- rem vyakhirev, gazprom  
		- making money from dirty transactions by selling state assets cheaper than market value  
  
- russia had inhereted weak & bankrupt state  
	- There had been massive debt racked up by the government. They were heavily dependent on oil revenues  
	- russia had to default at at their debt and be bailed out by the IMF  
	- inflation  
	- speculation against ruble by mikhail khodorkovsky, menatep bank  
	- looming elections in 1996  
		- oligarchs that came into power realized that it would be distaster if communists would win, so they got behind Yeltsin  
			- they gave **loans to government**  
			- poured money into Yeltsin's campaign  
  
- Yeltsin's vs Putin's oligarchs  
	- how do we know a weak state when we see one? // signs of a weak state  
		- low capacity to raise revenue  
			- Russia's inefficient tax system  
				- in oil industry they taxed output and exports, not profits  
				- they didn't have capacity to order companies to stop hiding profits  
	- Putin  
		- introduction of 13% income tax  
		- haphazard use of power  
			- idea that when government's capacity to **enforce legislature** is low it has to compensate by being unpredictable  
		- Putin's early moves  
			- taking down Khodorkovsky - Yukos, Rosneft  
			- taking down Vyakhirev (Gazprom) and its assets  
			- Bill Browder and Sergei Magnitsky  
				- investment advisor to the Hermitage Fund  
					- The primary investment strategy of Browder was shareholder rights activism. Browder took on large Russian companies such as Gazprom, Surgutneftegaz, Unified Energy Systems, and Sidanco  
					- Hermitage became "victim of what is known in Russia as 'corporate raiding': seizing companies and other assets with the aid of corrupt law enforcement officials and judges"  
					- The raids in June 2007 enabled corrupt law enforcement officers to steal the corporate registration documents of three Hermitage holding companies. They perpetrated a fraud, claiming (and receiving) a rebate of $230 million in taxes paid by those companies to the Russian state in 2006.  
				- In November 2008, one of Hermitage's auditors, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested. He was "charged with two counts of aggravated tax evasion committed in conspiracy with Mr. Browder  
					- Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, in prison, after eleven months in pretrial detention, nearly the limit allowed under the law.

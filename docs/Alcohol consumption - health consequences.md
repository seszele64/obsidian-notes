# Alcohol consumption - health consequences  
  
## Negative  
  
#### Cancer  
  
-   Alcohol use has been associated with increased risk for several types of cancer, with heavy use being associated with the highest risk (Bagnardi et al., 2015; Praud et al., 2016; Rumgay et al., 2021; Xi et al., 2017).  
      
    -   2015 meta-analysis of 572 observational studies, the relative risk (RR) of cancer with heavy alcohol use compared with no or occasional alcohol use was greatest for upper aerodigestive cancers (oral and pharyngeal [RR 5.13, 95% CI 4.31-6.10], esophageal [4.95, 95% CI 3.86-6.34], and laryngeal [2.65, 95% CI 2.19-3.19]), with a lesser elevation in risk for several other cancer types, including screen detectable cancers (breast and colorectal) (Bagnardi et al., 2015).  
          
-   A population-based cohort study in the United States found higher risks of incident cancer and cancer-related mortality with greater alcohol consumption, although a **combined endpoint of cancer** or all-cause mortality exhibited a J-shaped relationship with alcohol (Kunzmann et al., 2018)  
      
-   Even among light and moderate drinkers, some studies have indicated a trend toward an increased cancer risk, regardless of smoking history (Cao et al., 2015)  
      
  
#### Breast cancer  
  
-   There is consistent evidence that breast cancer risk is higher for individuals consuming both low (<1 drink per day) to high (≥3 drinks per day) levels of alcohol compared with abstainers (Allen et al., 2009; Bagnardi et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2011; Singletary and Gapstur, 2001; White et al., 2017)  
      
-   A 2013 meta-analysis of 110 epidemiologic studies showed a small but significant association between female breast cancer and light alcohol intake (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) (Bagnardi et al., 2013)  
      
-   Even light drinking was associated with elevated risk of breast cancer  
      
    -   “Increasing alcohol consumption was associated with increased breast cancer risk that was statistically significant at levels as low as 5.0 to 9.9 g per day, equivalent to 3 to 6 drinks per week” (Chen et al., 2011, p. 1)  
          
    -   There was a 10 percent increase in risk with each 10 grams per day of alcohol intake  
          
        -   “RR per 10 g per day for wine, 1.12” (Chen et al., 2011, p. 3)  
              
      
-   The proportion of breast cancer cases attributed to alcohol intake varies widely  
      
    -   US - the population attributable risk is estimated to be 2% (Tseng et al., 1999)  
          
    -   In Italy, where alcohol intake is higher, alcohol has been estimated to account for 11% of breast cancer cases (Mezzetti et al., 1998)  
          
    -   In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study of over 250,000 females in eight European countries, the attributable risk for breast cancer was 5% (Schütze et al., 2011)  
          
      
-   The effect of alcohol consumption on breast cancer risk may be modified by hormone therapy or intake of folate (Chen et al., 2002; Choumenkovitch et al., 2002).  
      
  
#### Gastrointestinal cancer  
  
-   Several types of gastrointestinal cancer are linked to alcohol consumption, even at low levels of intake, and studies suggest that both the amount and frequency of consumption are associated with increased risk.  
      
    -   increased frequency of alcohol consumption was associated with an increased incidence of several **gastrointestinal malignancies**, including **esophageal**, **gastric**, **colorectal**, **biliary**, and **pancreatic cancers** (Yoo et al., 2021)  
          
-   combined mortality rate for **cancers of the mouth**, **larynx**, **pharynx**, **esophagus**, and **liver** was 40 percent higher in less-than-daily drinkers compared with abstainers and rose progressively with heavier consumption (Thun et al., 1997)  
      
-   In the large European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, the alcohol-related attributable risk for males and females, respectively, was 44 and 25 percent for **upper gastrointestinal cancer**, 33 and 18 percent for **hepatocellular cancer**, and 17 and 4 percent for **colorectal cancer** (Schütze et al., 2011)  
      
    #### Liver disease  
      
-   The pathogenesis of liver disease associated with alcohol ingestion is incompletely understood. What is known is that some patients with alcohol use disorder develop liver disease, primarily because the liver metabolizes the majority of ingested ethanol  
      
-   Several factors contribute to the development of alcohol-associated fatty liver including reduced oxidation of hepatic fatty acids and increased lipogenesis (Zakim et al., 1965)  
      
-   The altered redox state in the liver induced by alcohol impairs beta-oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity (Adachi and Brenner, 2005)  
      
  
#### Hematologic complications  
  
-   Alcohol use at concerning levels can cause a variety of hematologic complications, including **anemia**, **leukopenia**, and/or **thrombocytopenia**.  
      
-   Anemia (hemoglobin or hematocrit below the age- and sex-specific reference ranges) & Leukopenia (reduced white blood cell count)  
      
    -   The cause of anemia and Leukopenia are often multifactorial and may include more than one of the following (Ballard, 1997; Girard et al., 1987; Latvala et al., 2004; Savage and Lindenbaum, 1986):  
          
        -   Direct toxic effects of alcohol on red blood cell (RBC) production in the bone marrow  
              
        -   Iron deficiency due to gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, alcoholic gastritis, ulcers, or other lesions  
              
        -   Nutritional folate deficiency from the effects of a poor diet  
              
  
#### Osteoporosis  
  
-   Heavy alcohol use predisposes to hip fracture by causing both osteoporosis and falls (BIKLE et al., 1985; Israel et al., 1980)  
      
  
#### Accidents and trauma  
  
-   highly significant age × BAC interaction (P < .0001) involving differences between drivers under 21 and those 21 and older (Peck et al., 2008)  
      
-   There is no evidence of a threshold blood alcohol (BAC) below which impairment does not occur, and there is no defined category of drivers who will not be impaired by alcohol. Alcohol increases not only the probability of collision, but also the probability of poor clinical outcome for injuries sustained when impaired by alcohol; more sophisticated studies show that significant impairment occurs at very low BACs (<0.02 gm/100 ml) (Ogden and Moskowitz, 2004).  
      
    -   risk of involvement in a collision while driving doubles at a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of only 0.05 percent (Voas, 1993)  
          
    -   Alcohol intake is also associated with a greater severity of injury in motor vehicle accidents (Hijar et al., 1998)  
          
      
-   Risk of injuries during operation of boats (Mengert et al., 1992), bicycles (Li et al., 2001; Olkkonen and Honkanen, 1990), and snowmobiles (Waller and Lamborn, 1975) is increased with alcohol use  
      
  
#### Violence  
  
-   Alcohol use increases the risk of violence. Alcohol is involved in one-half to two-thirds of all homicides, at least one-half of serious assaults, and more than one-quarter of all rapes  
      
  
#### Suicide  
  
-   Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of suicide (Hall et al., 1999)  
      
-   in a prospective study of over 128,000 enrollees in a Californian-managed care plan, intake of six or more drinks per day was associated with a sixfold higher risk of suicide, but more moderate drinking was not linked to risk (Klatsky and Armstrong, 1993)  
      
  
#### Pregnancy  
  
-   A safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has not been determined. Thus, multiple medical societies advise against alcohol use during pregnancy  
      
-   Abstaining from alcohol while pregnant eliminates the risk of alcohol-related birth defects and developmental disabilities, including resultant neurocognitive and behavioral problems  
      
-   It is estimated that one in every 67 women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy would deliver a child with FAS, which translates to about 119 000 children born with FAS in the world every year. (Popova et al., 2017)  
      
-   Meta-analysis of data from 231,808 pregnant women finds those exposed to alcohol during pregnancy have a greater risk of miscarriage compared to those who abstained (Sundermann et al., 2019)  
      
  
### psychiatric disorders  
  
-   “Is moderate drinking improving mental health or are mentally healthy individuals more likely to drink moderately?” (El-Guebaly, 2007, p. 60)  
      
    -   “Directions of causality remain to be further explored, as do their policy implications.” (El-Guebaly, 2007, p. 60)  
          
  
#### direct  
  
-   “Heavy alcohol use directly affects brain function and alters various brain chemical (i.e., neurotransmitter) and hormonal systems known to be involved in the development of many common mental disorders (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders) (Koob 2000).” (Shivani et al., 2002, p. 2)  
      
-   “Alcohol’s disinhibiting properties may also impair judgment and unleash aggressive, antisocial behaviors that may mimic certain externalizing disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) (Moeller et al. 1998).” (Shivani et al., 2002, p. 2)  
      
-   “In addition to the direct pharmaco­ logical effects of alcohol on brain function, psychosocial stressors that commonly occur in heavy-drinking alcoholic patients (e.g., legal, financial, or interpersonal problems) may indirectly contribute to ongoing alcohol-related symptoms, such as sadness, despair, and anxiety (Anthenelli 1997; Anthe­nelli and Schuckit 1993).” (Shivani et al., 2002, p. 2)  
      
  
#### co-occurrence  
  
-   Pre-existing psychiatric disorders may increase the risk of developing AUD, in part because alcohol is often used to cope with symptoms of psychiatric disorders, even if alcohol ultimately makes the problems worse (Turner et al., 2018)  
      
-   At the same time, alcohol use—especially adolescent drinking and long-term exposure to alcohol—may predispose individuals to develop psychiatric disorders (Hermens et al., 2013)  
      
-   AUD and other psychiatric disorders often share genetic risks and environmental vulnerabilities such as trauma and adverse childhood experiences (Brady and Back, 2012; Clarke et al., 2017; Prescott et al., 1994)  
      
-   Co-occurrence of AUD and another mental health disorder can complicate the diagnoses and negatively impact the clinical course of both conditions; AUD and psychiatric disorders may exacerbate each other, thereby producing poorer outcomes.  
      
-   **Anxiety disorders.** Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States. The prevalence of AUD among persons treated for anxiety disorders is in the range of 20% to 40% (Lai et al., 2015)(Castillo-Carniglia et al., 2019). So it is important to be alert to signs of anxiety disorders (see below) in patients with AUD and vice versa.  
      
    -   Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the co-occurrence of AUD and anxiety disorders. (Kushner et al., 2000) Further, since alcohol is readily available, it is commonly used to cope with anxiety. Alcohol may appear to relieve anxiety in the short term, but over time, heavy drinking and repeated withdrawal can escalate both the anxiety symptoms and maladaptive drinking.(Smith and Randall, 2012)  
          
      
-   **Other substance use disorders (SUD).** Widespread availability of alcohol leads to common co-use with other substances, both legal and illegal. As expected, AUD has strong comorbidity with other SUD. More than 40% of men and 47% of women with AUD have had another SUD in their lifetime.(Castillo-Carniglia et al., 2019) Having AUD raises the odds of another SUD by a factor of 3 to 5.(Grant et al., 2015; Hasin et al., 2007)  
      
    -   about 65% of marijuana users started drinking alcohol before they started using marijuana, and about 97% of cocaine users started drinking alcohol before using cocaine (Kandel and Kandel, 2015)  
          
-   **Nicotine use disorder**  
      
    -   “Upwards of 80% of individuals with DSM-IV alcohol dependence smoke cigarettes, and up to 30% of smokers have DSM-IV alcohol dependence. (Hertling et al., 2005; Miller and Gold, 1998)”  
          
    -   two models may explain why  
          
        -   “Cross-reinforcement refers to the ability of alcohol and nicotine to enhance the motivation to consume the other substance by acting on shared neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the reinforcement of drug effects (ie, mesolimbic dopamine pathway). The cross-tolerance model proposes that the repeated use of both alcohol and nicotine can facilitate tolerance to the pharmacological effects of one another;(Schlaepfer et al., 2008) eg, chronic nicotine use decreases the effects of alcohol,(Madden et al., 1995) causing an escalation of alcohol use and subsequently the progression to alcohol use disorder.(Adams, 2017)”  
              
      
-   **Mood disorders.** The mood disorders that most commonly co-occur with AUD are major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Among people with major depressive disorder, the co-occurrence of AUD ranges from 27% to 40% for lifetime prevalence (Grant and Harford, 1995; Hasin et al., 2018) and up to 22% for 12-month prevalence.(Lai et al., 2015) In clinical populations, people with bipolar disorder have the highest AUD prevalence, estimated at 42%.(Hunt et al., 2016) As with anxiety, it’s important to be aware of the signs of mood disorders (see below) in those with AUD and vice versa.  
      
    -   Major depressive disorder (MDD)  
          
        -   “Lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder in those with lifetime MDD ranges from approximately 27% to 40% across epidemiological studies in the USA77–79 with a median prevalence of 30% across 35 studies. (Sullivan et al., 2005)”  
              
      
-   **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).** PTSD is characterized primarily by alterations in arousal and recurrent intrusive thoughts that follow a traumatic event. Between 30% and 60% of people seeking treatment for AUD have co-occurring PTSD, (Smith et al., 2016) and the conditions may worsen each other. Thus, here, too, it’s important to be cognizant of the signs of PTSD in patients with AUD, and vice versa.

### LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE  
      
-   our understanding of its health effects remains limited by all of the challenges of observational research  
      
    -   “although the cardio protective effect of a light to moderate alcohol intake is quite well established, based on a large number of epidemiological studies, there are several factors which may influence the strength of the effect.” “It has been discussed whether a causal inference between alcohol and coronary heart disease can be drawn from studies using non drinkers of alcohol as the reference category as this group could consist of ‘sick-quitters’, i.e. participants who have been drinking excessively in former times, but stopped as a consequence of ill health.” (Shaper et al., 1988; Fillmore et al., 2006)  
    -   “Studies excluding participants with pre-existing disease at baseline and ex-drinkers reported lower protective effect of alcohol on coronary heart disease” (Grønbaek et al., 2000)  
  
## Confounder  
  
### Age  
  
-   “incidence of coronary heart disease varies greatly according to age”  
-   “proportion of death from cancer decreases after middle age, whereas the relative frequency of death from cardiovascular disease increases dramatically.” (Corrao et al., 2000)  
    
### Gender  
  
-   “Some results suggest that men have a more efficient first-pass metabolism for alcohol in the liver, whereas women may eliminate alcohol faster than men” (Gavaler et al., 1993)  
-   “In women, the risk decreased with intake up to 10 g /d of alcohol, showed evidence of protective effects up to 31 g /d and reached statistical significance of harmful effects at 52 g /d. The risk in men decreased with intake up to 25 g /d of alcohol, showed evidence of protective effects up to 87 g /d and reached statistical significance of harmful effects at 114 g /d” (Corrao et al., 2000)  
          
### Drinking patterns  
  
-   “Most studies with a measure of binge drinking (often defined as drinking more than a certain number of drinks per session, such as eight drinks) found increased risk amongst both men and women” (Murray et al., 2002) (Malyutina et al., 2002)  
-   “The risk of coronary heart disease is generally lower for steady versus binge drinking.” (Tolstrup et al., 2006)  
  
### Type of alcohol  
  
-   “meta-analysis suggested that wine conferred a larger protective effect than other types of beverages(Di Castelnuovo et al., 2002)” (Di Castelnuovo et al., 2002)  
-   “recent study showed differences in regard to development of abdominal obesity in favour for wine” (Vadstrup et al., 2003)  
-   However “Differences in results from country to country according to wine, beer and spirits may be attributable to socioeconomic or behavioural characteristics of wine, beer and spirit drinkers.” (Grønbaek, 2009, p. 416)  
                              
  
  
## HDL  
  
-  HDL  
      
    -   “increasing the HDL cholesterol in the blood, which is considered inversely related to coronary heart disease”  
          
        “HDL removes cholesterol from the arterial walls, facilitates the transportation back to the liver, thereby protecting against atherosclerosis.”  
          
    -   “A meta-analysis of a large number of experimental studies of the effect of alcohol on physiological mechanisms has found that 17% reduction in coronary heart disease caused by increased HDL directly attributable to the intake of 30 g of alcohol per day.”(Agarwal, 2002)  
  
 ## Fibriogen + triglycerides  
      
-   “moderate alcohol intake reduces the risk of coronary heart disease is through antithrombotic mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms in which the blood is prevented from coagulating.”  
	  
	-   “Alcohol has been found to lower the concentration of plasma fibrinogen, thereby, reducing platelet aggregability” (Renaud and Ruf, 1996)  
-   “In contrast, a positive association between alcohol intake and serum triglycerides have been found and raised levels of triglycerides increase the risk of coronary heart disease; however, serum triglyceride levels are strongly inversely associated with HDL cholesterol and some have suggested that the HDL-cholesterol level explains the association between triglycerides and coronary heart disease.”  
  
 ## Hypertension  
      
-   “A high alcohol intake is known to imply a high frequency of hypertension” (Beilin and Puddey, 2006)  
	. J shaped - “moderate intake of alcohol has been found to cause a short-term lowering of blood pressure.”  
	  
-   “One known reason that hypertension could lead to a higher risk of coronary heart disease is that it reduces the elasticity of vessels allowing lipids to deposit and thereby leading to thrombosis.”  
  
 ## Diabetes  
      
-   J-shape  
	-   “moderate alcohol intake leads to decreased insulin resistance and thereby lowers the risk of diabetes” (Koppes et al., 2005)  
	-   “moderate alcohol intake increases insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles, which could protect against obesity and diabetes” (Wild and Byrne, 2006)

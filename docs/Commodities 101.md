# Aluminium  
  
  
- ALUMINIUM IS THE MOST ABUNDANT metallic element in the Earth’s crust  
  
  
## Consumption  
  
>In 2011, consumption of aluminium was 42.4m tonnes (see Table 2.1), with China accounting for 42% of the total, the United States 9.6% and the EU 16.7%.  
  
- Primary aluminum demand, by region, 2020  
	- China accounted for the largest percentage of global demand (58.7%), followed by Europe (14.0%), Asia (excluding China) (11.4%), North America (9.2%), Latin America (1.7%) and other countries (5.0%).  
  
- The transport equipment industry is the largest consumer of aluminium in all forms, accounting for about 25% of consumption in 2008, followed by building construction (23%), packaging and electrical manufacturing (14% each).  
  
- Leading aluminium-consuming countries

---  
  
### Uses  
It has a wide range of end-uses in, for example, the electronics industry, transport (particularly aircraft and vehicles), construction, cooking utensils and food packaging.  
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/6WA8Ybm.png)  
  
- other properties include good conductivity, resistance to corrosion, elasticity and a low melting point (which makes it easily recyclable).  
  
  
  
## Production  
  
- Aluminum does not exist in a pure state in nature. The production of primary aluminum metal begins with bauxite ore, which is composed of hydrated aluminum oxide (40% to 60%) mixed with silica and iron oxide.[^1]  
  
- It takes approximately 4 to 5 tonnes of bauxite ore to produce 2 tonnes of alumina. In turn, it takes approximately 2 tonnes of alumina to produce 1 tonne of aluminum.[^2]  
  
- The production of aluminium is highly energy intensive (about 14,000kwh of electricity is needed to produce 1 tonne of aluminium) with the result that many smelters are located in energy-rich countries  
  
- the greatest expansion in aluminium smelting capacity in recent years has been in energy-rich regions or countries with low-cost electricity such as Canada, Australia, Russia, Southern Africa and the Middle East  
	- China’s 20 largest smelters account for about 70% of China’s capacity and about 30% of world output.  
  
- The 12 largest producers now control only 56% of world capacity. (2011)

# Copper  
  
- Copper is versatile: it is malleable and ductile; it has superb alloying characteristics; it is resistant to corrosion, strong, durable and recyclable; and it is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity.  
  
- Copper **occurs naturally** in the Earth’s crust and is extracted by both open-pit mining (the majority of copper mines) and underground mining.  
  
- Around 80% of copper mine production is in the form of concentrates (copper sulphide minerals typically containing around 30% copper before concentration), requiring smelting and refining  
  
  
## Consumption and trade  
  
### Uses  
  
- construction, principally building wire and plumbing, which accounted for about 33% of consumption in 2009

- Copper and its alloys still dominate in the production of connectors, but in telecommunications, where new technologies require high-speed data transmission, copper faces competition from fibre optics  
  
  
### Consumption  
  
- Leading copper-consuming countries  
	- China accounted for 40% of total consumption of copper in 2011, dwarfing the second largest single consumer, the United States, which accounted for about 9% of total consumption  
	- ![Pasted image 20220814141921.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220814141921.png)  
  
  
### Trade

	- ![Pasted image 20220814142101.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220814142101.png)  
  
### Markets  
  
- Copper is the most actively traded of the **base metals**[^3]  
  
- London Metal Exchange (**LME**) is the dominant price setter along with the Commodity Exchange Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (**COMEX/NYMEX**), which is the benchmark for the North American market. The Shanghai Futures Exchange is the main exchange in China  
  
  
## Production  
  
- In 2011 SX-EW accounted for 17% of refined copper  
	- SX-EW (solvent extraction and electrowinning), in which smelting is replaced by leaching, is a process that allows refined metal to be produced at the mine without further processing  
- Secondary copper smelters - 18% of refined production in 2011  
	- Secondary copper smelters use scrap copper as their feed  
  
  
### Reserves  
  
- Known copper reserves stood at just 340m tonnes in 1990, compared with the latest estimate in 2010 of 630m tonnes (see Figure 2.3)  
	- Copper reserves, 2010 	![Pasted image 20220814135846.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220814135846.png)  
  
  
### Mining  
  
- Copper mine production  
	- Chile’s **copper belt** continues north into Peru, Mexico and the United States and these four countries dominate world production, accounting for about 50% of the total in 2011.  
	- ![Pasted image 20220814142347.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220814142347.png)  
  
  
- Mining constraints  
	- falling ore grades are a problem, especially in the more mature copper-mining regions in Chile and the United States  
		- ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Evolution_minerai_cuivre.svg/1280px-Evolution_minerai_cuivre.svg.png)  
	- High energy costs have also lowered profitability as **mining operations are typically energy intensive**  
  
### Refining  
  
- In refining copper, the metal is melted down in a reverberatory furnace in a more or less oxidizing atmosphere and then further subjected to an oxidizing smelting in order to eliminate the common impurities, most of which have a stronger affinity for oxygen than has copper[^4]  
  
- Leading refined copper-producing countries  
	- ![Pasted image 20220814144046.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220814144046.png)  
  
- Leading copper refineries  
	- >In 2011, the largest eight companies producing copper accounted for 40% of total output  
	- ![Pasted image 20220814144108.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220814144108.png)  
  
  
### Stocks  
- Reported stocks of copper averaged a healthy 4.7 weeks of consumption between 1992 and 2002. But as demand from China gathered pace during the 2000s, stocks were drawn down and averaged just 1.5 weeks of consumption in 2004 and 2005. The global economic slowdown, by reducing consumption, allowed a recovery in stocks to around three weeks of consumption in 2009, but still historically low.  
	- they do not include countries’ strategic reserves  
		- Only a tentative estimate can be made of the size of China’s state copper reserves  
	- there are stocks held by corporate consumers that are not officially reported  
  
# Gold  
- GOLD IS ONE OF THE RAREST METALS in the world and one of the oldest known to man  
- gold market is larger and more liquid than almost all other commodity markets  
  
  
## Consumption  
  
- Gold jewellery consumption  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220815200441.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220815200441.png)  
  
  
### Uses  
- Its properties include strong resistance to corrosion and good conductivity; it is also malleable and ductile.  
- easily recyclable (low melting pot)  
	- ⚠️only **2%** of all the gold that has ever been mined has been lost over time  
- Gold consumption by type  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220815200205.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220815200205.png)  
- An additional source of demand in recent years has been central banks, which had been net sellers of gold for decades but since 2010 have become net buyers. (Gold is still the world’s third largest reserve asset behind dollar- and euro-denominated assets.)  
- **Industrial and dental use** of gold accounted for 11.4% of total gold consumption in 2011, according to the WGC, but it fell by 2.8% in that year and remained weak in 2012.  
  
### Trade  
- In 2010–11 consumption of gold more generally was boosted by concerns about sovereign debt in the euro zone and America’s fiscal woes  
- London is the largest market, with significant trading also in New York, Tokyo and Zurich  
- gold futures market is the largest commodity futures market after oil  
	- particularly in the United States on **COMEX** and electronic trading platforms (**CME Globex**), the Chicago **Board of Trade** and the **Tokyo Commodity Exchange**; they are also traded in India and Dubai and on the **Shanghai Futures Exchange**.

### Recycling  
- Recycled gold or scrap accounted for about 28% of annual supply in 2000–10, but its contribution swelled to over 40% in 2008–10 as economic uncertainty led to some distressed selling and high prices further encouraged sales  
  
  
## Price trends  
- gold prices are typically inversely correlated with the dollar  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220815202130.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220815202130.png)  
	- Gold prices vs US Dollar Index[^5]  
		- ![Attachments/xauusd cur.png](./images/xauusd%20cur.png)  
	- This reflects gold’s property as a hedge against inflation as well as its appeal as a **safe haven in times of dollar uncertainty**  
- appeal of gold is enhanced when interest rates are low  
	- Gold is also perceived as a hedge against inflation  
  
  
  
# Silver  
  
- It has many of the same chemical properties as gold, and because it is more plentiful and cheaper its industrial uses are more extensive.  
- ductile, malleable, high electrical and thermal conductivity  
  
  
## Consumption  
  
- In 2011, industrial consumption of silver accounted for **47%** of total consumption, while jewellery and net investor demand accounted for 15% and 16% respectively

		- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220816091551.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220816091551.png)  
  
  
- biggest market for silver jewellery is India  
- Silver is also used in electrical conductors, switches and circuit breakers, batteries, mirrors and photographic film  
	- In 2019, the photovoltaic sector accounted for 10% of total silver demand, comprising 98.7 million ounces within total demand of 991.8 million ounces, according to Metals Focus data.[^6]  
  
### Trade  
- As the silver market is much smaller than the gold market, there have been instances in the past where a large buyer has tried to corner the market in an attempt to manipulate prices (most famously, in the late 1970s, the Hunt brothers), but no one has succeeded  
  
## Production  
  
- Mine supply accounted for about 73% of annual silver supply in 2011, with the remainder made up of scrap recycling and negligible amounts of official sales and producer hedging.  
  
- Leading silver-producing countries, 2011

# Platinum  
- one of the rarest elements in the Earth’s crust  
- malleable and ductile, has a high melting point, is an excellent electrical conductor and is highly resistant to corrosion  
  
## Consumption  
  
- Platinum’s main industrial use is in **catalytic converters in diesel-powered cars**, accounting for 38% of total consumption in 2011  
- Slightly less than one-third of total consumption of the metal is in jewellery  
  
- Platinum consumption by sector, 2011  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220817183113.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220817183113.png)  
  
  
###  Trade  
- Platinum is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the London Platinum and Palladium Market; NYMEX also has platinum futures contracts  
  
  
## Production  
  
- South Africa dominates production, accounting for approximately 75% of annual output of platinum, with 90% of that being sourced in the Western Bushveld region  
- Leading platinum-producing countries  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220817183436.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220817183436.png)  
  
## Price trends  
- small size of the market – at least compared with gold – makes it particularly vulnerable to a loss of investor confidence or liquidity  
- The platinum price is considered in terms of its relationship with gold.  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220817183941.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220817183941.png)  
  
  
## Future  
- 👎  
	- South Africa’s share of production is starting to slip as a result of uncertain and expensive power supplies, declining ore grades and rising costs, notably wages  
	- Volatile prices create considerable uncertainty for mining companies, given that it takes years to develop a mine and capital costs are typically high.  
	- concentration of mining in a few countries makes the supply of the metal vulnerable to disruption

### market  
- Trade in lead concentrate is based on treatment charges, an arrangement for sharing the price of lead between miners and smelters  
- Concentrates are traded mainly on the basis of annual contracts, typically set in the first quarter of the year  
- The contracts are set on a basis price plus adjustments that take into account changes in London Metal Exchange (**LME**) lead prices.  
  
## Production  
- Lead is usually found in ore form with silver, zinc and/or copper and is mined in conjunction with these metals  
- ⚠️Only **5%** of mined output is from lead-only mines  
  
### Mine production

## Price trends  
- One feature of the lead market that is more powerful than in other metal markets is the ability of trends in the secondary market to influence prices  
	- Lower lead prices tend to depress the supply of secondary lead (scrap), which in turn leads to reduced supply of total refined lead and thus leads to a renewed tightening of the market balance

## Future  
- 👎  
	- it appears that lead-acid batteries perform poorly in hybrid and all-electric cars, with producers preferring to use other batteries, notably lithium  
	- Steps to reduce pollution and energy intensity in China could have negative consequences for the country’s mining and smelting industries

### Uses  
- manufacture of austenitic stainless steel accounts for about two-thirds of total nickel consumption  
	- Nickel, which is used to make stainless steel and the batteries used in electric cars, has suffered an extremely turbulent year. - 2022-11-17 [^7]  
		- That was followed by a 5 per cent rise on Tuesday after a ==nickel mine in New Caledonia, which supplies Tesla, cut its fourth-quarter production forecast.==  
		- volatile price movements were a testament to the low liquidity that has haunted the market since the LME suspended and cancelled billions of dollars worth of nickel trades in March following an unprecedented price rise  
		- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20221117020933.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020221117020933.png)  
  
- Nickel can constitute 10% or more of austenitic steels, but the most common alloys contain 8% nickel and cheaper grades use as little as 6%  
- Nickel improves workability by counteracting the embrittling effect of chrome, while maintaining and enhancing corrosion resistance

### Mine production  
- Russia has dominated mine production for decades, typically accounting for about 15–20% of global output  
- Russia’s formerly state-owned Norilsk Nickel is the largest nickel producer in the world, originally because of its control of about 80% of Russian capacity, but since privatisation it has acquired capacity abroad and diversified into other metals  
  
- Nickel mine (or raw) production

	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220821172424.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220821172424.png)  
  
## Price trends  
- The widespread use of scrap by the steel industry and the use of nickel pig iron in China (predominantly) complicate the supply/demand dynamics of the nickel market  
- Speculators jumped on the strong demand bandwagon and exaggerated the price rise. It was this price bubble that inspired the adoption of nickel pig iron, which was a significant factor in the subsequent slump in price  
- Nickel stocks and prices  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220821172757.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220821172757.png)  
  
- The financial crisis had a double impact on nickel prices. Tight liquidity constrained the operations of speculative funds and obliged some speculators to liquidate metal holdings, which drove down LME cash prices  
	- Meanwhile the negative effect on the real economy reduced physical demand and generated a surplus that depressed prices further.  
  
## Future  
- 👍  
	- Solid consumption growth is expected to be maintained despite cyclical lows and highs. Stainless steel plays an important role in urbanisation and industrialisation – trends that are expected to continue in the developing world.  
	- outlook for China’s stainless steel industry is in the balance  
  
  
# Tin  
  
- ONE OF THE EARLIEST METALS known to man  
- During the Bronze Age, tin was added to copper to make bronze  
- low melting point, is malleable and resistant to corrosion, and alloys readily with other metals  
- non-toxic and easy to recycle  
- Tin supply does, however, still rely on mining and the refining of tin-containing ores  
  
## Consumption  
  
  
- China overtook the EU as the world’s largest consumer of tin in 2003 and in 2011 the country accounted for 43% of total consumption  
- Leading tin-consuming countries  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220824201704.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220824201704.png)  
  
  
- Tin consumption in Western industrialised countries is in long-term decline, owing mainly to the migration of electronics manufacturing and other tin-using industries to lower-cost countries. With the switch to lead-free solders, EU consumption rose to a peak in 2006–07 but has declined since then. Nevertheless, it remains the world’s second-largest tin market, accounting for 17.4% of world consumption in 2011.

### Market  
  
- London Metal Exchange (LME) is the focal point for tin prices  
- Most (over 95%) of the LME’s tin stocks are held in Singapore and Malaysia.  
  
  
  
## Production  
  
- process  
	- To produce refined tin, tin concentrates are reduced to metal by heating to 1,250°C in a furnace. The molten tin is separated from waste products and cast into slabs. After smelting, the crude tin produced is refined to remove the remaining metallic impurities.  
  
- reserves  
	- Primary (hard rock) deposits account for about 30% of reserves  
  
- Secondary or placer deposits, which derive originally from the weathering and erosion of primary deposits, account for about 70% of world tin reserves and occur mainly as alluvial material in river beds and valleys and on the sea floor close to shore  
  
- countries  
	- tin is mined mainly in Asia and South America  
	- Four countries – China, Indonesia, Peru and Bolivia – accounted for 85% of world output in 2011

	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220825120820.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220825120820.png)  
  
### Uses  
- Zinc is used mainly in galvanising, die casting and brass (alloyed with copper), which together account for around 80% of its use  
	- Galvanising is by far the largest market (about 50% of total zinc use, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group)  
		- Construction is the largest consumer of galvanised steel (45% of total zinc use), accounting for over half of the market. Transport accounts for approximately 25%, with consumer goods and electrical appliances at 23% and general engineering at about 7%.

### Market  
- The London Metal Exchange (LME) is the main futures market for zinc  
  
  
## Production  
  
- Zinc is usually mined in conjunction with a number of other metals, notably lead, silver, copper and, less frequently, gold  
- Approximately 80% of mines are underground operations, 10% open-pit and the remainder a combination of both. In terms of production, large open-pit mines account for as much as 15% of the total, with underground mines producing 65% and combined mines 20%.  
- The hydrometallurgical process (HP) is by far the most important production process, accounting for nearly 90% of output

### Mining  
- zinc ores contain 5–15% zinc and need to be concentrated to increase the zinc content to around 55%  
- concentrate also contains 25–30% sulphur, which must be removed by roasting (sintering) before smelting  
- In 2011 four of the largest producing countries – Australia, China, Peru and the United States – accounted for 62% of total mine output

## Future  
- 👎  
	- Important industry to watch is automobiles. There has been some switching away from galvanised steel in vehicles to aluminium, which is lighter in weight and thus more fuel-efficient.  
  
  
# Coal  
  
- COAL IS A FOSSIL FUEL or hydrocarbon  
- Coal has been used as a source of energy for thousands of years, with evidence of use in Ancient Greece, Imperial China and the Roman Empire.  
- Based on current production, the world’s reserves of coal will last another 118 years, according to the World Coal Association  
  
- There are four main types of coal:   
	- **anthracite** (about 1% of total reserves, with the highest carbon content),  
	- **bituminous** (about 50% of reserves),  
	- **sub-bituminous** (about 30% of reserves)  
	- **lignite** (about 19% of reserves), with the lowest carbon content).  
  
## Consumption  
- Coal is predominantly used in power generation. According to the IEA, it generated 34.2% of electricity in OECD countries in 2011 and 46.2% of electricity in non-OECD countries in 2010.  
- China is by far the largest consumer of coal, accounting for 48% of total consumption in 2011  
  
- Leading coal-consuming countries

- 👎  
	- legislative pressure on green energy sources  
	- relatively small reserves  
- 👍  
	- viewed as safe energy source, especially in the aftermath of nuclear plant disasters  
  
# Natural gas  
  
- NATURAL GAS IS A FOSSIL FUEL or hydrocarbon gas  
It is found in underground rock beds or with other hydrocarbons (oil and coal deposits).  
- The carbon emissions associated with the combustion of gas are lower than for coal or oil, so gas is perceived to play a major role in efforts to control (and reduce) such emissions globally.  
	- 50% lower than coal, 25% lower than oil  
  
## Consumption  
- electricity-generating industry is by far the largest consumer of gas, followed by buildings (where gas is used to power boilers generating hot water and space heating, primarily in the OECD) and industry (metal refining, petrochemicals, iron and steel)  
  
- regional gas consumption

### market  
- no global benchmark price forming the basis of most international trade!  
  
## Production  
  
- gas reserves, 2011  
	- overall reserves estimated at 208.4 trillion cubic metres in 2011  
	- ![Attachments/Pasted image 20220830213956.png](./images/Pasted%20image%2020220830213956.png)  
- According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), known gas reserves will last for 59 years based on its estimates of future consumption, but this largely excludes sources of unconventional gas.  
- Unconventional gas accounted for 16% of global gas output in 2011  
  
- Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a clear liquid that is created when natural gas is cooled to around −160°C.  
  
- Regional gas production  
	- >In 2011, Russia and the United States together accounted for 39% of total gas production
